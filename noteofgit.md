# Note about Git (Week 3)
**Git** is one of the *Version Control Systems*. <br>
**GitHub** (https://github.com/) is the website that host several repositories. <br>
Version control using Git is done by "commit" or saving the snapshots of the progress. <br>
There are three main commands for Git
```
#Stage files to be committed:
$ git add
#Commit all currently staged changes:
$ git commit
#Get the status of the repository:
$ git status
```
